To operations can be broken into the following steps
1) Encoding
    building tree from data :   involves getting freq of data = O(n)
                                heapify the data - O(n)
                                the loops runs len(unique_elements) - 1 , which is linear = O(#elements)
   encoding is a tree-traversal pre order - O(n)
   creating encoded data from table - 0(n)


2) Decoding - O(n)

    Altogether = approx O(6n)
