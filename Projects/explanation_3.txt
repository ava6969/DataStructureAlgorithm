To operations can be broken into the following steps
1) Encoding
    building tree from data :   involves getting freq of data = O(n)
                                heapify the data - O(nlogn)
                                the loops runs len(unique_elements) - 1 , which is linear = O(#elements)
   encoding is a tree-traversal pre order - O(n)
   creating encoded data from table - 0(n)
Space Complexity = counter Dictionary - O(n) + heapified list O(n) = O(2n)

2) Decoding - O(n)
Space Complexity = O(1) since we append text


Altogether = approx O(nlogn + 5n)
