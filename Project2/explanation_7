The Router uses the trie data structure to parse its links. this works because the individual part of the http link are
connected to each other . So its space efficient.

For time Effieciency,
add_handler - happens in O(log(n)) worst case because we have to traverse to just one leaf and append at the end
lookup - this operation is also a O(log(n)) because we only have to loop through one branch.
